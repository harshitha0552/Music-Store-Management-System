# 🎵 Music Store Management System (SQL Project)

Welcome to the **Music Store Management System** SQL project developed by **Priya Dakhore & Akurala Harshitha** as part of a hands-on data analysis journey. This project demonstrates the creation, population, and querying of a relational database to manage music tracks, customers, employees, and invoices using **SQL**.
